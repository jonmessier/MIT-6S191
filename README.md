MIT 6S191 Intro to Deep Learning
I recently follow the MIT 6S191 Intro to Deep Learning w/ Tensorflow course.  I was impressed with the level of detail and quality that went into a free class and would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in Tensorflow and deep learning techniques.  I was however a little dissapointed that the Themisai.org section which used Capsa for calculations of Aletoric and Epistemic uncertaininty are no longer open source.  Congrats to the authors on their acquisition!  I just wish I had a chance to play with the tools before they were sold.  

Overall this course increased my understanding of neural networks, deep learning, uncertaininty estimation and creating pipelines for project evaluations.
